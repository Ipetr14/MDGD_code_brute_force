'''
Description: Python code for the brute force algorithm, version with the "bamboo" or "stick"
Author: Petr Myagkov
Modification Log:
    March 23, 2026: Created file wrote foundational function for html parsing (were mostly already implemented by Vishesh Prasad)
    March 24, 2026: Started implementing function for different rules that are required to draw edges
    March 26, 2026: Implemented the basic version of the algo, F1 around 41%, added a couple features like uniting together equations that don't have any words between them and dealing with contractions
    March 28, 2026: Added support of inline references, found the best thresholds, F1 around 53%
